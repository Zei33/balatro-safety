# Balatro Safety (Balamod)
This is a mod for Balatro which presents a confirmation window when you take potentially game-ruining actions. Balatro has no rewind feature, and when you're playing hands for hours at a time, it's easy to make a mistake. A simple mistake shouldn't cost you a good run.

## Current features
The mod will present a confirmation box upon the usage of these spectral cards. Clicking cancel will give you the opportunity to pick another.
- Ankh: Creates a copy of 1 of your Jokers at random, then destroys the others, leaving you with two identical Jokers
- Hex: (Adds Polychrome to a random Joker, and destroys the rest)

## Upcoming features
More functionality will be added in stages as the mechanisms to do them will need more complexity.
